	Team YACC Checkpoint 3 Test 2
	Must test semantic errors only
	Must contain a maximum of 3 errors

	This test checks for assignment compatibility of
	enumerated/scalar-list types.

	Errors are
	Line 36: Cannot assign integers to enumerated types
	Line 37: Assignment must be of the same numerated type
	Line 38: arithmetic operations are not valid for enum types
}
program test(input, output);

	things = (shirts, pants, coats);

	item := shirts;
	item := pants;
	item := coats;
	item := succ(coats);	// not a semantic error, but a run-time error
	item := pred(shirts);	// same
	
	item := 2;		// error
	s := red;		// different enumerated types
	i := red + blue;	// cannot perform arithmetic on enums

	// these are valid:
	inv[red] := 2.2;
	inv2 := inv;
