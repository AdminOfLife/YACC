# Asc implementation of trunc()
# From the expression x that shall be of real-type, this function shall return
# a result of integerType.  The value of trunc(x) shall be such that if x is
# positive or zero, then 0 < x-trunc(x) < 1; otherwise -1 < x- trunc(x) < 0.
# It shall be an error if such a value does not exist.
# TODO: when can an error occur?
# NOTE: super easy, ROTI does trunc() for us.
