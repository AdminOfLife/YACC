# return a result that shall be of the same type as that of the expression x.
# The function shall yield a value whose ordinal number is one greater than that
# of the expression x, if such a value exists.  It shall be an error if such a 
# value does not exist.

# For scalar types we get to have even more fun.  Each item in an enumerated

# largest value amongst the consts in the enumerated type (e.g., the number
# of elements in the enumerated scalara - 1, where we subtract 1 as the
# standard specifies that the values of the constants beings at 0).  This
# "largest" value will be passed as the second parameter to __succ_scalar
