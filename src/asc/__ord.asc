# ASC implementation of the ord() function.
# From the expression x that shall be of an ordinal-type, this function shall
# return a result of integer-type that shall be the ordinal number of the value
# of the expression x.
#
# For us this is really easy: all ordinal types are represented as ints,
# so we literally just return the value we were given.  Fantastic.
