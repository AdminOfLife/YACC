YACC - Yet Another CMPUT 415 Compiler
====

CMPUT 415 Compiler Project

Installation
----

To build, use `make`. The `pal` executable will be located at `bin/pal`.

To build the unit testing executable, use `make test`, which will produce
the test executable at `bin/test`.
To build the lexical tester, use `make lextest`, which will build
`bin/lextest`. This binary prints the tokens, in the order the lexer reads them,
to standard output.

There is also a debug build, `make debug`, which enables VERY verbose debugging
ouput.

To run the entire suite of tests, use `make integration_tests` and
`make unit_tests`.

Usage
----

Please refer to the man page for usage. Try `nroff -man pal.man | less`.

Files
----

Source files are in the `src/` directory. Building the application places
some object files in `bin/` along with the final binaries.

The makefile is located in the root directory (the same directory as this
readme file). The default rule builds the pal compiler.

Tests for Checkpoint 1 are numbered 0 through 9 with file extension '.pal'
and are located in the root directory.

Documentation is in `docs/` as a `documentation.PDF`.

The man page is located in the root directory with filename `pal.man`.

Further unit tests are located in `test/unit/' and more pal test cases are
int `test/integration/syntax/`, `test/integration/semantic/` and
`test/integration/full`. There are also '.tokens' files in these directories
which contain test output for the lex tester (see Installation for how to build
this).
Some automated ASC code generation tests are included as well, in
`test/asc/`
